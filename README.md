===Website Brief===

The client would like us to build a responsive website called MakeYourVoteUp which is targeted at young adults of both genders. The goal of the website is to help a Canadian citizen to decide who they should vote for in the next general election. This is done by providing information on the relevant parties and making it easier for the user to compare and contrast. The website must also provide a log in and members section which allows the user to cast votes for parties if they like where they stand on certain issues. The culmination of these votes should indicate which party the user is aligned closest to. There must also be an email subscription service that will send a HTML formatted email to the user when they first subscribe. The website should inform and excite the user to politics.
The website should display information for the following 6 major federal political parties of Canada.
Liberal Party of Canada
Conservative Party of Canada
New Democratic Party
Bloc Québécois
Green Party of Canada
Libertarian Party of Canada

===Product Backlog===

As a visitor I can select one of the Canadian parties and view information related to their history, leader, prominent party policies and their current position in the Canadian Government.

As a visitor I should be able to navigate to one of the other parties easily when viewing them in the above section.

As a visitor on a desktop or tablet device I should be able to see an image of Canada and from here can select a province. After selecting said province I should be shown a list containing all the current MPs belong to that region.

As a visitor on a mobile device I should not be shown an image but some other method must be in place for me to see the current MPs of a province that I select.

As a visitor I can select one or more parties to scrutinise on their stance on many policies or political issues. I should clearly see the issue or topic plus a brief synopsis of the party’s stance/opinion or track record. On mobile devices where it is not manageable to display more than one party at a time, I should be able to navigate quickly between them. 

As a visitor I can filter these policies or political issues to only show ones related to a particular group or groups e.g. Economy, Environment, Education, Foreign Affairs etc.

As a visitor I will not see the voting UI nor is it possible for me to vote.

As a visitor I should be able to subscribe to a newsletter by inputting my email address.

As a visitor I can sign up to become a member of the website by giving an email address and password.

In addition to the above a member should have the following

As a member I can log in from anywhere on the site. 

As a member once I log in my member’s page will show details of which parties I prefer based on how I voted in the policy section. This information can be graphical (highcharts.js) or take some other interesting form. Also a random fact and an image associated to my preferred party should be displayed.

If I haven’t voted in the policy section yet, some text should encourage me to do so and a random fact and an image associated to a random party should be displayed.

As a member in the comparing party’s policy section I should see some UI that allows me to vote for a party on a particular issue. I should be able to change my vote if I want and I can skip votes if I like. Some interface must be in place to show me which parties I am leaning towards based on my total number of votes.

As a member that is logged in, I will not see the “Log In” button. This will be replaced by a “Members” button which will bring me to my member’s page.
